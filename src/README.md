# Mergington High School Activities API

A super simple FastAPI application that allows students to view and sign up for extracurricular activities.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Sign up for activities

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to:
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc

Run the commands from the `src` directory. The application creates
`src/activities.sqlite` on first launch, initializes its schema, and seeds the
default activities. The database file is retained across restarts and is
excluded from Git. To store it elsewhere, set `ACTIVITIES_DB_PATH` to the
desired database file path before starting the application.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/activities`                                                     | Get all activities with their details and current participant count |
| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |
| DELETE | `/activities/{activity_name}/unregister?email=student@mergington.edu` | Unregister from an activity                                        |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

Activities and participant registrations are stored in SQLite. Run the
automated persistence and API behavior tests from the repository root with:

```
python -m unittest discover -s src -p "test_*.py"
```
